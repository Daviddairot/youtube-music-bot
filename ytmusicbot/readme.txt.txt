for you to use this bot you will have to have a python interpter/IDE like vscode with python installed on the PC.

--install tor browser
--open geck.py in your python IDE 
--change the Tor browser(firefox) path(line 16) into your own path where you installed your tor/firfox.exe
--the driver needed is in the this folder
--with this you can start using the bot
-- you can make it more easy by opening the folder where you have this file in CMD
--run pip install cx_freeze
|__pyinstaller geck.py --target-dir dist

this will make the geck file and exe file

NB. the sleep time in the code was set to a case of bad network, you can adjust it to your own network speed. it will actually give you more view ca=ount if you can make it fast or run the 
bot on more than one system or virtual machine, to increase stream count


the exe will be located in the dist file that will be created


***Good Luck***
